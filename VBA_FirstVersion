Introduction :
	VBA stands for Visual Basic for Applications an event-driven programming language from Microsoft that is now predominantly 
used with Microsoft office applications such as MSExcel, MS-Word, and MS-Access.


Tools
	=>you should install MS Office, particularly MS-Excel.



Why Use VBA.

	=>MS-Excel provides only basic inbuilt functions which might not be sufficient to perform complex calculations.



Accessing VBA Editor

	First Option:

	=>ALT+F11

	Second Option :

		Step 1 − First, enable 'Developer' menu in Excel 20XX. To do the same, click File → Options.

		Step 2 − Click ‘Customize the Ribbon’ tab and check 'Developer'. Click 'OK'.
	

Modules:
	 Modules is the area where the code is written.	
	 To insert a Module, navigate to Insert → Module
	 
		Within the modules, we can write VBA code and the code is written within a Procedure. A Procedure/Sub Procedure is a 
	series of VBA statements instructing what to do.



Procedure
	Procedures are a group of statements executed as a whole.
	the programmers to divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions.



Comment:
	Comments are used to document the program logic and the user information.

	Comments in VBA are denoted by two methods.
		=>Single Quote (')
			Ex:' This Script is invoked after successful login '
		=>starts with the keyword "REM"
			Ex: REM This is my first Progrma.
		
		

Displays a message:

		Using MsgBox() displays a message.
		Syntax:
           MsgBox(prompt[,buttons][,title][,helpfile,context])
		   
		Description:
			=>Prompt − A Required Parameter. A String that is displayed as a message in the dialog box. The maximum length of prompt is approximately 1024 characters.
			
			=>Buttons − An Optional Parameter. A Numeric expression.If left blank, the default value for buttons is 0.
			
			=>Title − An Optional Parameter. A String expression displayed in the title bar of the dialog box. If the title is left blank, the application name is placed in the title bar.
			
			=>Helpfile − An Optional Parameter. A String expression that identifies the Help file to use for providing context-sensitive help for the dialog box.

			=>Context − An Optional Parameter. A Numeric expression that identifies the Help context number assigned by the Help author to the appropriate Help topic
		   

Buttons parameter:

		The first group (0 to 5) indicates the buttons to be displayed in the message box.
		=>	0 vbOKOnly - Displays OK button only.

		=>	1 vbOKCancel - Displays OK and Cancel buttons.

		=>	2 vbAbortRetryIgnore - Displays Abort, Retry, and Ignore buttons.

		=>	3 vbYesNoCancel - Displays Yes, No, and Cancel buttons.

		=>	4 vbYesNo - Displays Yes and No buttons.

		=>	5 vbRetryCancel - Displays Retry and Cancel buttons.
	
		The second group (16, 32, 48, 64) describes the style of the icon to be displayed
		=>	16 vbCritical - Displays Critical Message icon.

		=>	32 vbQuestion - Displays Warning Query icon.

		=>	48 vbExclamation - Displays Warning Message icon.

		=>	64 vbInformation - Displays Information Message icon.

	   The third group (0, 256, 512, 768) indicates which button must be the default,
		=>	0 vbDefaultButton1 - First button is default.

		=>	256 vbDefaultButton2 - Second button is default.

		=>	512 vbDefaultButton3 - Third button is default.

		=>	768 vbDefaultButton4 - Fourth button is default.


		Ex:
			'Message Box with title, yes no and cancel Butttons'
			
             a = MsgBox("Do you like blue color?",3,"Choose options") 
  
            msgbox ("The Value of a is " & a) 

    ****Note : When if you click any button then the msgbox return one of the following values.****
		
		=>1 - vbOK - OK was clicked

		=>2 - vbCancel - Cancel was clicked

		=>3 - vbAbort - Abort was clicked

		=>4 - vbRetry - Retry was clicked

		=>5 - vbIgnore - Ignore was clicked

		=>6 - vbYes - Yes was clicked

		=>7 - vbNo - No was clicked



Variable:Variable is a named memory location used to hold a value.
	
	===>basic rules for naming a variable.

		=>You must use a letter as the first character.

		=>You can't use a space, period (.), exclamation mark (!), or the characters @, &, $, # in the name.

		=>Name can't exceed 255 characters in length.

		=>You cannot use Visual Basic reserved keywords as variable name.

	Syntax
		you need to declare the variables before using them.
		Using "Dim" Keyword 
			Dim <<variable_name>> As <<variable_type>>

Data Types/variable type
	
	In VBA data types divided into two main categories, namely numeric and non-numeric data types.

	=========Numeric Data Types=================
		
		Type					Range of Values
		
		Byte					0 to 255
		
		Integer					-32,768 to 32,767
		
		Long					-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,648
		
		Single					-3.402823E+38 to -1.401298E-45 for negative values

								1.401298E-45 to 3.402823E+38 for positive values.


		Double					-1.79769313486232e+308 to -4.94065645841247E-324 for negative values

								4.94065645841247E-324 to 1.79769313486232e+308 for positive values.

		Currency				-922,337,203,685,477.5808 to 922,337,203,685,477.5807

		Decimal					+/- 79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,335 if no decimal is use

								+/- 7.9228162514264337593543950335 (28 decimal places).
		
	
		=========Non-Numeric Data Types===============
		
		Type							Range of Values

		String (fixed length)			1 to 65,400 characters
		
		String (variable length)		0 to 2 billion characters
		
		Date							January 1, 100 to December 31, 9999

		Boolean							True or False

		Object							Any embedded object

		Variant (numeric)				Any value as large as double

		Variant (text)					Same as variable-length string


	Example
			Dim password As String
			password = "Admin#1"

			Dim num As Integer
			num = 1234

			Dim BirthDay As Date
			BirthDay = DateValue("30 / 10 / 2020")

			MsgBox "Passowrd is " & password & Chr(10) & "Value of num is " & num & Chr(10) & "Value of Birthday is " & BirthDay

    Note: Here  synbole (&) use for String concantet 

Take Input From User:
		
				Using InputBox function :After entering the values, if the user clicks the OK button or presses ENTER on the 
	keyboard, the InputBox function will return the text in the text box. If the user clicks the Cancel button, the function will return an empty string ("").


	Syntax:
		InputBox(prompt[,title][,default][,xpos][,ypos][,helpfile,context])

		Example:
			Function sumval() 
			   Dim a As Integer 
			   Dim b As Integer 
			   
			   a = InputBox("Enter value of a ", "Enter a Number") 
			   b = InputBox("Enter value of b", "Enter a Number") 
			   sumval = a * b 
			End Function
